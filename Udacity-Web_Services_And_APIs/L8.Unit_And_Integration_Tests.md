# L8. Unit And Integration Tests

## 1. Introduction

TOPIC : Testing my APIs.

First, unit testing your small piece and then integrating your piece with all of the other system components with integration testing.

## 2. Overview

Testing gives you confidence that your application is working when you make changes, so you’ll want to introduce automated testing and make testing a normal part of your development process. First, unit test your small piece, then integrate your piece with the other system components to conduct integration testing.

#### Dependency

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

```Spring-boot-starter-test``` imports both Spring Boot test modules as well as ```JUnit```, ```AssertJ```, ```Hamcrest```, and a number of other useful libraries.

## 3. Unit Testing

We will first look at unit testing REST APIs using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/), [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) and [Spring Test](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/web/servlet/MockMvc.html) (also known as, MockMVC).

 * JUnit is a popular unit testing framework that allows you to test individual units of source code.
 * Mockito is a great mocking framework which provides data for JUnit tests.
 * @MockBean works well with the Mockito library.
 * @WebMvcTest is used for controller layer unit testing. and is often used to test one controlelr class at a time, and works in combination with Mockito to mock the dependencies. @WebMvcTest scans only the controllers(@controllers, @RestControllers).
 * If your controller has dependency on other beans for example a bean from the service layer, the test will not run until either you load the bin yourself or provide a mock for it.
 * This is where the @MockBean annotation comes into play.
 * @WebMVCTest speeds up testing by only loading a small portion of your app for unit testing.

## 4. Case Study: Unit Testing

The code can be cloned from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/videolearning/udacity-java/tree/master/Lesson8-testing).

#### REST API Components
 * Controller - LocationController.java
 * Service - LocationService.java and LocationServiceImpl.java
 * CRUD Repository - LocationRepository.java
 * Domain Entity/Model - Location.java
 * H2 Database accessible via http://localhost:8080/h2/
 * Tomcat Server accessible via http://localhost:8080

#### Unit Testing Components
 * LocationControllerUnitTest.java

#### Integration Testing Components
 * LocationControllerIntegrationTest.java

 * @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) : defines the runner class to be used to run test cases. And using SpringRunner which is great choice since we are using Spring to build this application. 
 * @WebMvcTest(LocationController.class) : Using specific controller that you're trying to test that's what you pass in.
 * MockMvc 객체 : offers a powerful way to quickly test MVC controllers without needing to start a full HTTP server. @WebMvcTest auto-configures MockMvc for us.

```java
@MockBean
LocationService locationService;
```
 * @MockBean : Mocking the specific service using this annotation. This creates a Mockito Mock of the services which are dependencies for the location controller.


```java
@Test
public void getAllLocations() throws Exception {
    mockMvc.perform(get("/location/"))
           .andExpected(status().isOk())
           .andExpect(content().contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8))
           .andExpect(content().json("[]"));
    verify(locationService, times(1)).retrieveLocations();
}
```
 * @Test : Inditate it's a Unit Test.
 * perform() for mockMvc : this simulates an HTTP request to a REST controller. We're making a GET request to this location path for our rest controller.
 * Expectations : Setting expectations on HTTP responses received from the controller class.
 * verify() : verify the number of times a mock method has been called. Here, mocking the ```locationService``` and saying like i only want it called once and i want retrieveLocations() method to be called.

```java
@Test
public void getLocation() throws Exception {
    mockMvc.perform(get("/location/1"))
           .andExpect(status().isOk());

    verify(locationService, times(1)).retrieveLocation(1);
}
```
 * perform() for mockMvc : to simulate the call.

## 5. Integration Testing



Integration testing allows for testing of the entire application (and all of its layers) as opposed to just individual components.

The ```@SpringBootTest``` annotation is useful for integration testing and is chosen over ```@WebMvcTest``` because ```@SpringBootTest``` starts the full application context (including the server) and does not customize component scanning at all.

```@SpringBootTest``` will look for the main configuration class, annotated with ```@SpringBootTest``` and use that to start a Spring application context that simulates a calling client.
