# L2.REST APIs

## 1. Introduction

## 2. Architecture Style

### Guidelines

<img width="704" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65400195-d44f3000-ddfb-11e9-9109-6ef191bf6288.png">

__REST__ stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It’s a set of guidelines application developers use to design APIs.

There are four principles that APIs follow:

1. Data and functionality in the API are considered “resources” and identified through something called the URI, or Uniform Resource Identifier. These are accessed by web links.

2. Resources are manipulated using a fixed set of operations. __GET__ retrieves a resource. __POST__ creates one. Use __PUT__ to update the resource, and of course, __DELETE__ will remove it.

3. Resources can be represented in multiple formats, such as HTML, XML, plain text, and other formats defined by a media type.

4. Communication between the client and server (i.e. endpoint) is stateless. This means the server will not remember or store any state about the client that made the call.

### Benefits

Restful APIs are easier to create and easier for many clients to consume. They are used a lot for web integration and mobile device applications.

## 3. Case Study: Intro & Maven Dependencies

<img width="731" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65400327-7ec75300-ddfc-11e9-92e0-5d7e47d08476.png">


The case study is a REST API that retrieves a list of locations from a database. The code can be cloned from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/videolearning/udacity-java/tree/master/Lesson2-restapis).

 * spring-boot-starter-web : This starter pack is used for web application development and automatically adds libraries like Spring MVC, REST, Tomcat, and Jackson.

 * com.h2database : This starter pack is used for the H2 in-memory database. H2 is an open source database written in Java. It's in-memory which means that the data is stored in memory and not persisted to disk. H2 is great for development environments, doing small simple POC's. It's never really used in a production environments. H2 can be easily integrated with spring and it also provides a useful admin tool called the console.

 * spring-boot-starter-data-jpa : This starter pack includes JDBC, Hibernate, Transactions API, JPA, and Aspects.

Spring Initializer 로 spring-boot-starter-web, H2 database, spring-boot-starter-data-jpa 의존성 주입 후 프로젝트 생성.

그 후 application.properties 에 다음과 같이 H2 database 관련 설정 입력

```
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:locationtracker
```

## 4. Lab I: Build a Dog REST API (Set Up)

 * Enable the console, add a path for the console, and create a url for the datasource using H2.

 Within ```application.properties``` (found within /src/main/resources/), you could add the following code:

```
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:dogdata
```

Note that dogdata is just what I chose as the name - yours does not need to match this.

## 5. Case Study: Annotations

The case study is a REST API that retrieves a list of locations from a database. The code can be cloned from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/videolearning/udacity-java/tree/master/Lesson2-restapis).

<img width="731" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65401040-8ee13180-de00-11e9-8152-7dbac25c3ff7.png">

 * entity : Objects that limit the database and they have the ability to be mapped from the database table to a Java object. Entites are defined by ```@Entity``` annotation.

 * controller : Receive and respond to client requests for data. ```ResponseEntity<...>``` represents the entire HTTP response, that includes the status code, headers, and the response body. We can fully configure what's returned. ```HttpStatus.OK``` means i was able to retrieve the data and everything went well.  

```java
@GetMapping("/location")
public ResponseEntity<List<Dog>> getAllLocations() {
    List<Dog> list = locationService.retrieveLocations();
    return new ResponseEntity<List<Dog>>(list, HttpStatus.OK);
}
```

 * service : Service is indicated with the at ```@Service``` annotation. And implementation is typically where you put the business logic.
 
 * repository : Spring data repository abstraction here crud repository. It greatly reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to implement a data access layer for the H2 database. So ```CrudRepository<T, Long>``` uses the spring data JPA repository and it automatically creates simple queries behind the scenes using method names.

## 6. Case Study Continued

Spring Boot packages the code and deploys it to the embedded Tomcat server and we'll able to access that using local hosts.

localhost:8080/h2 로 접속하면 (application.properties에 설정해둔 h2 path) entity로 설정해 둔 모델이 테이블로 생성되어 있다.

## Lab

### Project : DogRestAPI

you can see the potential results of a valid ID being used in the GET request, as well as the error when an invalid ID was used. Note that you can further customize this error page (I didn't add an explicit mapping for /error as noted in the image), but you can see that the error reason was appropriately returned at the bottom.
