__Web Services, API, Micro Services__ allow you to share data between two separate systems. They integrate two totally different systems so that data can flow seamlessly between the two.

### What is a Web Service?

<img width="703" alt="webservices" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65105255-4d6f1180-da0f-11e9-8c91-7579a8e76ea0.png">

__A web service is a way to share data between two disparate systems or way to retrive data to display in your application.__ 

Web services are designed to communicate with other programs or applications rather than directly with users and are often used to integrate systems allowing data to flow seamlessly between the two.

The communication typically happens between a client and a server.

 * Client - The client makes a request for data.
 * Server - The server responds to the client's request.

### Web Service Communication

<img width="702" alt="webservice" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65105739-e2bed580-da10-11e9-9d4d-616605bce448.png">

The system's needing to communicate can be any combination of systems, mobile phone to a window server, mainframe system to a java web application, or even Web service to web service communication.

For example, a web service created in a .NET platform can be invoked by any client application implemented in a different programming language like Java. 

And due to language transparency, you are able to develop services and our client side code using the languages and tools you want.

<img width="705" alt="uber" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65105740-e3576c00-da10-11e9-8606-5e5578e76137.png">

For example, you may have a client application running on your mobile phone that retrieves it's data from a web service running on a server as opposed to data stored locally on the phone.

The Uber app is a great example of this. The Uber app is downloaded and installed locally on your cell phone.

However, the data for where the nearest Uber driver is located is not stored locally on your phone.

__The Uber mobile app makes a web service call to retrive that data from Uber application servers.__

### How Web Services Work

<img width="704" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65111105-b063a700-da15-11e9-803b-7a4a3f79a8ee.png">

The communication typically happens between a client and a server sometimes called the service provider. 

The client makes a request for data or information and the server responds to that request.

The means of communication between the client and server is via __a standard web protocol__ like HTTP (or HTTPS) on the world wide web, that uses a common language like JSON or XML.

A client invokes a web service by sending an XML (or JSON) message, then waits for a corresponding XML response from the server.

Message formats are like different languages; English, Korean, Portuguese, etc. That allows system to talk to each other.

Human speak Englisk or Korean or Portuguese while computers speak JSON or XML.

Web services can provide data in a number of different format but JSON and XML are the most common.

<br><br>

<img width="706" alt="XML" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65111106-b0fc3d80-da15-11e9-8821-47b1947f5939.png">

XML(Extensible Markup Language)이 오랫동안 markup language로써 데이터를 구조화 하는데 사용되었다.

<br><br>

<img width="702" alt="JSON" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65111108-b0fc3d80-da15-11e9-9c81-c7cdf79da11a.png">

JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)은 텍스트 기반의 데이터 교환 포맷이며 JavaScript scripting language 로 부터 유래되었다.

JSON은 key-value 쌍으로 formatting 되고, XML보다 훨씬 가볍다.

### How Web Services Work

 * Step 1: The web service provider (the person who created the web service) defines a standard format for requests and also for the responses provided.

 * Step 2: The client sends a request to the web service across the network.

 * Step 3: The web service receives the request and performs an action (like query a database or perform a calculation) and sends a response back to the calling client.


__Client__ : The System requesting information.

__Server__ : The System providing the information.

__Service Provider__ : The organization or person that created the web service.

## 5. Benefits of Web Services


<img width="706"  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65112432-9e383780-da1a-11e9-8242-5f54d57f37b1.png">

Web services support __reusability__ of code because they are meant to be small components, they can be used by multiple systems.

Web services makes sense when you need to reuse the same data in several applications.

<img width="707"  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65112433-9ed0ce00-da1a-11e9-87a6-8697d3544c29.png">

예를 들어 내가 핸드폰으로 링크드인에 접속하여 feed 를 업로드 하는 과정도 웹 서비스를 이용하여 데이터를 전송하고, 그 데이터가 저장이 되는 식이다.

<img width="664"  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65112434-9ed0ce00-da1a-11e9-8909-82f47ac333d8.png">

Web services also promote __usability__ as they are an easy way to expose business logic and data to other systems in a secure fashion to a wide range of audiences and platforms.

These two key features allow organizations to use web services provided by third parties. This reduces development time and delivers more powerful applications.

<img width="702"  src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65112435-9ed0ce00-da1a-11e9-9608-5d7104bc15a6.png">

예를 들어 비행기의 위치를 제공해주는 서비스를 제공하는 경우, 클라이언트 개개인은 자신만의 서비스를 설치하거나 환경을 만들어 사용하지 않아도 된다. 단지 웹에 접속해서 모든 현황을 조회가 가능하다.

The concepts of reusability and usability allow organizations to use web services provided by third parties. This reduces development time and delivers more powerful applications.

## 6. Web Services vs APIs vs Microservices

SOAP to REST

SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) : messaging protocol that uses XML to allow applications running on different systems or platforms to communicate.

<img width="732" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-19 at 3 26 14 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/65218714-04dc5480-daf2-11e9-9dc2-e2405e286a8b.png">

### API
 * ligntweight and streamlined than a web service as web services typically carry more overhead to work with them.
 * APIs typically have a more lightweight architecture and are good for devices with limited bandwidth like mobile devices.
 * Web services are often dependent on SOAP protocol to send and receive data over a network.
 * All web services are APIs, but not all APIs are web services.

### Microservices
 * Similar to APIs
 * Fully contained individual components that communicate with each other in calling clients
 * modeled around a specific business domain.
