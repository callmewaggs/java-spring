## 2. Security Overview

### Data Access

When allowing access to data via web services, security is important.

We want to limit who can view or even update data. Only trusted indivisuals should have access.

So how does web service security work?

Let's use a cell phone as an example. In order to open your cell phone to call your friend, you have to unlock your phone by entering a pass code.

The pass code is like the key or the token used to secure a web service.

Let's say your friend will not answer calls from random numbers. And she only answers your call because she knows it's you.

You are able to call her because you had the key or token to unlock your phone.

Web services that are secure behave in a similar manner.

__If an unsecured request is made to a web service to retrieve data. If that requests lacks the proper key or API token that request is rejected.__

When allowing access to data via web services, security is very important. We want to limit who can view or even update data; only trusted individuals should have access.

## 3. Authentication vs Authorization

### Authentication
Authentication is about validating the identity of a client attempting to call a web service. Typically, identity is validated with user credentials, such as a user name and password.

Authentication is simply like unlocking your phone with your pass code. This step says "yes, i have access to what's on this phone."

### Authorization
Authorization is the next step after authentication. So once a client is authenticated (they have proven who they are), what do they have access to? For example, what data can they view, are they allowed to change that data, etc.

This concept is similar to sharing a Google Docs with collaboators. Once you share that document with a person via email and they use that email to access the document, what can they do? Can they just view the data or can they edit it too?

TWO ways to authenticate with a web service.
 * API Key
 * Username and Password

## 4. Basic Authentication

<img width="697" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/67846904-4aeef400-fb45-11e9-8d78-1aca52730d61.png">

Basic Authentication (also referred to as Basic Auth) is the simplest protocol available for performing web service authentication over HTTP protocol. Basic Auth requires a username and password. The client calling the web service takes these two credentials, converts them to a single Base 64–encoded value and passes it along in the Authentication HTTP header.

The server compares the credentials passed to those stored. If it matches, the server fulfills the request and provides access to the data. If the Authentication HTTP header is missing or the password doesn’t match the user name, the server denies access and returns a 401 status code, which means the request is Unauthorized.

API Key Authentication is another technique used to secure Web Services, which requires the API to be accessed with a unique key. This unique key is like the pass code to your phone.

[Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security) is a part of the Spring Framework and provides authentication, authorization and other security features for Spring-based applications.

| Item | Description | 
|:----:|:-----------:|
| spring-boot-starter-security	 | Maven dependency that adds security module.
 |
| @EnableWebSecurity | Annotation that enables Spring Security’s support.

## 6. Case Study

The Security case study retrieves a list of locations from a database in a secure fashion. The code can be cloned from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/videolearning/udacity-java/tree/master/Lesson5-security).

The API has the following components:

 * Controller - LocationController.java
 * Service - LocationService.java and LocationServiceImpl.java
 * CRUD Repository - LocationRepository.java
 * Domain Entity/Model - Location.java
 * Security Configuration - SpringSecurityConfig.java
 * H2 Database accessible via http://localhost:8080/h2/
 * Tomcat Server accessible via http://localhost:8080

We can do security configurations entirely in a Java class, bt creating a config class that extends ```WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter```.

#### SpringSecurityConfig.java
```java
@Configuration  // indicating that it's a configuration.
@EnableWebSecurity  // this enables Spring Security's web security support
public class SpringSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {    // by extending WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter, we are able to override 
                                                                            // a couple of its methods to set some specifics of the web security configuration.
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .csrf().disable()   // disabling the CSRF feature. Cross-Site Request Forgery.
                .authorizeRequests()  // authorizing requests,  
                .anyRequest()         // any request authenticated.
                .authenticated()      // Simply this means all requests to the API requires authentication.
                .and()                // we are allowing users to use HTTP basic autientication. The basic Auth << That we talked before.
                .httpBasic();
    }

    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)
            throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()   // creating an in-memory user and that's what we'll use for authentication.
                .withUser("admin")  // that user name is admin
                .password(encoder().encode("password"))     // and it's password
                .roles("USER");     // and just giving a simple role of user.
    }

    // when we use Basic Auth, the password is base 64 encoded, so this method helps me do that.
    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder encoder() {  // encoder.
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```

Postman 을 사용하여 테스트 해 본다.

http://localhost:8080/locations 로 get 요청을 보내보면, 기존에는 받아 봤던 locations 정보가 'Unauthorized' 로 표시되며 받는것이 불가하게 된다. 상태 코드는 401이다.

이렇게 나오는 이유는 Spring Security 를 켰기 때문이다. 그리고 그 설정에 모든 클라이언트는 요청을 보낼 때 username과 password를 authentication 조건으로 걸어놨다.

Authorized 한 요청을 보내는 방법은 다음과 같다.

포스트맨에서 Authorization 탭의 요청 type을 Basic Auth 로 설정한 뒤(Basic Auth를 사용하고 있으므로),
Username 과 Password 를 적어준다.(Header에 Value로 application/json 으로 설정되어있는지 확인)

이렇게 보내면 Basic Auth 를 거친 요청을 보내게 된다. 결과적으로 요청에 대한 응답이 잘 나오게 됨.

## 7. Lab: Secure Your Dog API

### Lab: Secure Your Dog API
Reuse your Dog REST API code from Lesson 2 and secure it using Basic Authentication.

 * Step 1: Add the necessary dependencies for Spring Security in the Maven POM file.

 * Step 2: Create the necessary security configuration class that extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter to secure your API with Basic Authentication.

 * Step 3: Test that your API is now secured with basic authentication and still operates appropriately for an authenticated user.

## 8. Lab Solution: Secure Your Dog API

### Solution: Secure Your Dog API
Below, we'll walk through each step of the lab and look at one potential way to implement the lab. Even if you get stuck, you should always first try to work through the lab without the solution before coming here, so that you can best learn the related skills and be ready for the project at the end of the course.

#### Step 1: Add the necessary dependencies for Spring Security.
Given your code for the REST API from before, you just need to add the following two dependencies to the Maven POM file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-security-test</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Step 2: Create the necessary security configuration class.
 * the class should extend ```WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter``` to secure your API with Basic Authentication

First, add a ```config``` package to your Dog REST API code, and then add a ```SpringSecurityConfig``` class within it that extends ```WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter``` from Spring Security.

From there, the code follows similarly to how the Location API was secured in the earlier Case Study video, although welcome to update the username and password used below (and required to do so in any more in-depth implementation, of course). Note that the class uses both the ```@Configuration``` and ```@EnableWebSecurity``` annotations.

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SpringSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .csrf().disable()
                .authorizeRequests()
                .anyRequest()
                .authenticated()
                .and()
                .httpBasic();
    }

    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth)
        throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
                .withUser("admin")
                .password(encoder().encode("password"))
                .roles("USER");
    }

    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder encoder() {
        return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
    }
}
```

Note in the above that all of the . functions are actually chain together, but are on separate lines so that someone reading the code can more easily understand it.

#### Step 3: Test that your API is now secured.
 * It should use basic authentication
 * The API should still operate appropriately for an authenticated user

You can test this out in multiple ways. First, I tried to access localhost:8080/dogs in the browser, and got a "Sign in" window. If I click cancel, I get a 401 error - Unauthorized. If I enter in my basic authentication information, I can access the page.

I can also test this in Postman instead, where I change the "Authorization" tab to use "Basic Auth", make sure I am using a GET request, and then first attempt without a username and password. I will again get a status code of 401 meaning I am unauthorized. If I add the correct username and password, I can access the API.

## 9. Recap

 * Authentication is about validating the identity of a client, that is attempting to call a web service that accesses your secure data.

 * Authorization is next step after authentication. So once a client is authenticated, they have proven who they are, what do they have access to.
