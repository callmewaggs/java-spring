Rest is the most popular way to expose data from a server through an API. However, the response returned from a Rest API is very rigid, and returns all of the data points as designed by the developer, whether you need them or not.

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs or a syntax that describes how to ask for data and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. The neat thing about GraphQL is that it lets the calling client or the user specify exactly what data it needs. GraphQL offers maximum efficiency and flexibility because it allows the calling client to specify exactly what data it needs.

Query of GraphQL looks like this. 

To include GraphQL in your project, a couple of dependencies are needed:

 * graphql-spring-boot-starter - This starter is very helpful because it will add and automatically configure a GraphQL Servlet that you can access at /graphql . This starter will also use a GraphQL schema library to parse all schema files found on the classpath. The starter will also set up an endpoint that can access POST requests.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
    <artifactId>graphql-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

 * graphql-java-tools - A helper library to parse the GraphQL schema.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
    <artifactId>graphql-java-tools</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.4</version>
</dependency>
```

## 3. Schemas

There is a concept that you should be aware of when dealing with GraphQL. It's the __schema.__

The GraphQL schema defines the data points offered via an API. The schema contains the data types and relationships between them and the set of operations available, things like queries for retrieving data and mutations for creating, updating, and deleting data.

The schema from the Case Study is shown below.

#### Sample Schema of GraphQL
```
type Location {
 id: ID!
 name: String!
 address: String!
}

type Query {
 findAllLocations: [Location]!
}

type Mutation {
 newLocation(name: String!, address: String) : Location!
 deleteLocation(id:ID!) : Boolean
 updateLocationName(newName: String!, id:ID!) : Location!
}
```

__There can only be one root Query and one root Mutation type in a schema file.__

__GraphQL schema files found on the classpath are processed and the necessary beans are wired.__

__The file extension for a GraphQL schema file : ```.graphqls```__

---

## 4. Operations

GraphQL offers operations on data like queries and mutations.

### Queries
__A query allows for the retrieving of data.__ Each query will have a specific object that it returns and based on the object returned, you can add or remove fields to match the exact data you need to fit your specific use case.

### Mutations
GraphQL has the ability to update the data stored on the server, by means of mutations. __Mutations, such as, create, update, or delete will change the data,__ unlike a query.

---

## 5. GraphiQL

A tool called __GraphiQL is a simple web app that is able to communicate with any GraphQL Server and execute queries and mutations__ against it.

## 6. Case Study: Steps

The case study is a GraphQL API that retrieves a list of locations from a database. The code can be cloned from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/videolearning/udacity-java/tree/master/Lesson3-graphql).

The REST API has the following components:

 * Controller - LocationController.java
 * Service - LocationService.java and LocationServiceImpl.java
 * CRUD Repository - LocationRepository.java
 * Domain Entity/Model - Location.java
 * Schema - location.graphqls and via the GraphiQL console at http://localhost:8080/graphql/schema.json.
 * Mutator - Mutation.java
 * Query - Query.java
 * H2 Database accessible via http://localhost:8080/h2/
 * Tomcat Server accessible via http://localhost:8080
 * GraphiQL console accessible via http://localhost:8080/graphiql

#### Sample Queries/Mutations
```
{
  findAllApplications {
    id
    owner
    address
  }
}
```
```
mutation {
  newLocation(
    name: "MBJ Airport",
    address: "Montego Bay, Jamaica airport location") {
      id 
      name
      address
    }
}
```
```
mutation {
  deleteLocation(id:1)
}
```

## 7. Case Study: Bootstrap & Configure

새로운 프로젝트 생성(Spring boot initializer) 후 의존성으로 ```WEB```, ```JPA```, ```H2``` 를 넣어주고 생성한다. 그 뒤 pom.xml에 아래 GraphQL 관련 의존성을 별도로 추가해준다.

```xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
			<artifactId>graphql-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
			<version>5.0.2</version>
		</dependency>

        <dependency>
			<groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
			<artifactId>graphql-java-tools</artifactId>
			<version>5.2.4</version>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
			<artifactId>graphiql-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
			<version>5.0.2</version>
		</dependency>
```

그리고 application.properties 파일을 셋팅해준다.

```
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:dogdata

graphql.servlet.mapping=/graphql
graphql.servlet.enabled=true
graphql.servlet.corsEnabled=true

graphiql.enabled=true
graphiql.endpoint=/graphql
graphiql.mapping=/graphiql
```

이전 dogrestapi 프로젝트와 H2 database 관련 셋팅은 동일하고, 아래에 추가적으로 GraphQL 및 GraphiQL 셋팅을 추가해준다.

---

## 8 - 9. Lab (Project Setting)

Note that you don't necessarily have to use the exact same spring.datasource.url, graphql.servlet.mapping, graphiql.endpoint, or graphiql.mapping, but that will affect where you go down the road. However, graphql.servlet.mapping and graphiql.endpoint do need to match, as that is how GraphQL and GraphiQL will interact.

---

## 10. Case Study: Schema Creation

Schema is to find the data points in operations offered via an API.

```graphql-java-tools``` dependency is a helper library that assists with parsing GraphQL schemas. Behind the scenes, schema files found anywhere in the class path are process, and the necessary beans are wired.

All schema files must end in the 'graphqls' like ```location.graphqls``` and can be present anywhere.

#### Sample Schema - Location
```
// types of fields (field : type)
type Location {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    address: String!
}

// root query.
type Query {
    findAllLocations: [Location]!
}

// root mutation.
type Mutation {
    newLocation(name: String!, address: String) : Location!
    deleteLocation(id:ID!) : Boolean
    updateLocationName(newName: String!, id:ID!) : Location!
}

```

__There can only be one root query and one root mutation.__ Each file will contain all of the query and mutation operations for the given type. The location type here is defined along with all the queries and mutations.

type 을 적어주는 란에 있어서 !(exclamation point) 는 required 를 의미한다. 그리고 ```[]```(brackets) 은 array 를 의미한다. 

__Every complex type in the GraphQL server like 'Location' is represented by a corresponding Java class or Object.__

따라서 @Entity 애너테이션을 달은 Location 클래스는 GraphQL 상의 Location schema와 정확히 mapping되게 된다.
