Rest is the most popular way to expose data from a server through an API. However, the response returned from a Rest API is very rigid, and returns all of the data points as designed by the developer, whether you need them or not.

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs or a syntax that describes how to ask for data and is generally used to load data from a server to a client. The neat thing about GraphQL is that it lets the calling client or the user specify exactly what data it needs. GraphQL offers maximum efficiency and flexibility because it allows the calling client to specify exactly what data it needs.

Query of GraphQL looks like this. 

To include GraphQL in your project, a couple of dependencies are needed:

 * graphql-spring-boot-starter - This starter is very helpful because it will add and automatically configure a GraphQL Servlet that you can access at /graphql . This starter will also use a GraphQL schema library to parse all schema files found on the classpath. The starter will also set up an endpoint that can access POST requests.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
    <artifactId>graphql-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>5.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

 * graphql-java-tools - A helper library to parse the GraphQL schema.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
    <artifactId>graphql-java-tools</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.4</version>
</dependency>
```

## 3. Schemas

There is a concept that you should be aware of when dealing with GraphQL. It's the __schema.__

The GraphQL schema defines the data points offered via an API. The schema contains the data types and relationships between them and the set of operations available, things like queries for retrieving data and mutations for creating, updating, and deleting data.

The schema from the Case Study is shown below.

#### Sample Schema of GraphQL
```
type Location {
 id: ID!
 name: String!
 address: String!
}

type Query {
 findAllLocations: [Location]!
}

type Mutation {
 newLocation(name: String!, address: String) : Location!
 deleteLocation(id:ID!) : Boolean
 updateLocationName(newName: String!, id:ID!) : Location!
}
```

__There can only be one root Query and one root Mutation type in a schema file.__

__GraphQL schema files found on the classpath are processed and the necessary beans are wired.__

__The file extension for a GraphQL schema file : ```.graphqls```__

---

## 4. Operations

GraphQL offers operations on data like queries and mutations.

### Queries
__A query allows for the retrieving of data.__ Each query will have a specific object that it returns and based on the object returned, you can add or remove fields to match the exact data you need to fit your specific use case.

### Mutations
GraphQL has the ability to update the data stored on the server, by means of mutations. __Mutations, such as, create, update, or delete will change the data,__ unlike a query.

---

## 5. GraphiQL

A tool called __GraphiQL is a simple web app that is able to communicate with any GraphQL Server and execute queries and mutations__ against it.

---

## 6. Case Study: Steps

The case study is a GraphQL API that retrieves a list of locations from a database. The code can be cloned from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/videolearning/udacity-java/tree/master/Lesson3-graphql).

The REST API has the following components:

 * Controller - LocationController.java
 * Service - LocationService.java and LocationServiceImpl.java
 * CRUD Repository - LocationRepository.java
 * Domain Entity/Model - Location.java
 * Schema - location.graphqls and via the GraphiQL console at http://localhost:8080/graphql/schema.json.
 * Mutator - Mutation.java
 * Query - Query.java
 * H2 Database accessible via http://localhost:8080/h2/
 * Tomcat Server accessible via http://localhost:8080
 * GraphiQL console accessible via http://localhost:8080/graphiql

#### Sample Queries/Mutations
```
{
  findAllApplications {
    id
    owner
    address
  }
}
```
```
mutation {
  newLocation(
    name: "MBJ Airport",
    address: "Montego Bay, Jamaica airport location") {
      id 
      name
      address
    }
}
```
```
mutation {
  deleteLocation(id:1)
}
```

## 7. Case Study: Bootstrap & Configure

새로운 프로젝트 생성(Spring boot initializer) 후 의존성으로 ```WEB```, ```JPA```, ```H2``` 를 넣어주고 생성한다. 그 뒤 pom.xml에 아래 GraphQL 관련 의존성을 별도로 추가해준다.

```xml
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
			<artifactId>graphql-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
			<version>5.0.2</version>
		</dependency>

        <dependency>
			<groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
			<artifactId>graphql-java-tools</artifactId>
			<version>5.2.4</version>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.graphql-java</groupId>
			<artifactId>graphiql-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
			<version>5.0.2</version>
		</dependency>
```

그리고 application.properties 파일을 셋팅해준다.

```
spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:dogdata

graphql.servlet.mapping=/graphql
graphql.servlet.enabled=true
graphql.servlet.corsEnabled=true

graphiql.enabled=true
graphiql.endpoint=/graphql
graphiql.mapping=/graphiql
```

이전 dogrestapi 프로젝트와 H2 database 관련 셋팅은 동일하고, 아래에 추가적으로 GraphQL 및 GraphiQL 셋팅을 추가해준다.

---

## 8 - 9. Lab (Project Setting)

Note that you don't necessarily have to use the exact same spring.datasource.url, graphql.servlet.mapping, graphiql.endpoint, or graphiql.mapping, but that will affect where you go down the road. However, graphql.servlet.mapping and graphiql.endpoint do need to match, as that is how GraphQL and GraphiQL will interact.

---

## 10. Case Study: Schema Creation

Schema is to find the data points in operations offered via an API.

```graphql-java-tools``` dependency is a helper library that assists with parsing GraphQL schemas. Behind the scenes, schema files found anywhere in the class path are process, and the necessary beans are wired.

All schema files must end in the 'graphqls' like ```location.graphqls``` and can be present anywhere.

#### Sample Schema - Location
```
// types of fields (field : type)
type Location {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    address: String!
}

// root query.
type Query {
    findAllLocations: [Location]!
}

// root mutation.
type Mutation {
    newLocation(name: String!, address: String) : Location!
    deleteLocation(id:ID!) : Boolean
    updateLocationName(newName: String!, id:ID!) : Location!
}

```

__There can only be one root query and one root mutation.__ Each file will contain all of the query and mutation operations for the given type. The location type here is defined along with all the queries and mutations.

type 을 적어주는 란에 있어서 !(exclamation point) 는 required 를 의미한다. 그리고 ```[]```(brackets) 은 array 를 의미한다. 

__Every complex type in the GraphQL server like 'Location' is represented by a corresponding Java class or Object.__

따라서 @Entity 애너테이션을 달은 Location 클래스는 GraphQL 상의 Location schema와 정확히 mapping되게 된다.

## 11. Lab (Continue)

#### resources > graphql > dog.graphqls
```
type Dog {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    breed: String!
    origin: String!
}

type Query {
    findAllDogs: [Dog]!
    findDogById(id:ID!): Dog!
}

type Mutation {
    deleteDogBreed(breed:String!) : Boolean
    updateDogName(newName: String!, id:ID!) : Dog!
}
```

Now, you may be thinking I did not actually implement the query operations that were requested. But wait - using GraphQL, the user will be able to specify which fields they want from a query. So, simply by adding the queries for find all dogs (where they can request only breed, or only names), and finding a dog by id (where they can request just the breed), these operations actually exist.

### Create a repository that extends CrudRepository.

This repository is for creating, reading, updating, and deleting Dog objects.
Depending on how you implemented your DogRepository for the REST API, you may be able to completely re-use your code here. I actually chose to completely remove any queries from within the DogRepository, as there are already built-in methods for a CrudRepository that findAll and findById.

#### DogRepository.interface
```java
public interface DogRepository extends CrudRepository<Dog, Long> {
}
```

### What about the service and controller?
We don't need these to implement a GraphQL API. If you still want to have a REST API available, you can add those files to the application as well, and the same endpoints as before will be available.

---

## 12. Case Study: Queries & Mutations

#### Query.java
```java
@Component
public class Query implements GraphQLQueryResolver {
    private DogRepository dogRepository;

    public Query(DogRepository dogRepository) {
        this.dogRepository = dogRepository;
    }

    public Iterable<Dog> findAllDogs() {
        return dogRepository.findAll();
    }
}
```

__GraphQLQueryResolver__ : allows spring to automatically detect and call the right method in response to one of the GraphQL queries declare inside of schema.

#### dog.graphqls
```
type Dog {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
    breed: String!
    origin: String!
}

type Query {
    findAllDogs: [Dog]!
    findDogById(id:ID!): Dog!
}

type Mutation {
    deleteDogBreed(breed:String!) : Boolean
    updateDogName(newName:String!, id:ID!) : Dog!
}
```

this schema going to be mapped to repository's methods in the query class.


#### Mutation.java
```java
@Component
public class Mutation implements GraphQLMutationResolver {
    private DogRepository dogRepository;

    public Mutation(DogRepository dogRepository) {
        this.dogRepository = dogRepository;
    }

    public boolean deleteDogBreed(String breed) {
        boolean deleted = false;
        Iterable<Dog> allDogs = dogRepository.findAll();
        // Loop through all dogs to check their breed
        for (Dog d:allDogs) {
            if (d.getBreed().equals(breed)) {
                // Delete if the breed is found
                dogRepository.delete(d);
                deleted = true;
            }
        }
        // Throw an exception if the breed doesn't exist
        if (!deleted) {
            throw new BreedNotFoundException("Breed Not Found", breed);
        }
        return deleted;
    }

    public Dog updateDogName(String newName, Long id) {
        Optional<Dog> optionalDog = dogRepository.findById(id);

        if(optionalDog.isPresent()) {
            Dog dog = optionalDog.get();
            dog.setName(newName);
            dogRepository.save(dog);
            return dog;
        } else {
            throw new DogNotFoundException("Dog Not Found", id);
        }
    }
}
```

GraphQL has the ability to update the data stored on the server by using a mutator.

__GraphQLMutationResolver__ : allows spring to automatically detect and call the right method in response to one of the GraphQL mutations declare inside of schema.

---

## 13. Case Study: Exception Handling

Let's talk about custom exception.

Some of this has been handled in the above for the Query and Mutation. You might be tempted to fully re-use your code for DogNotFoundException from earlier, but we need a few changes for it to work properly with GraphQL (note that if you were also adding on a separate REST API using a service and controller, you may want to use separate exception handling for it). This time, you'll want to have it implement a GraphQLError, and no longer use the @ResponseStatus annotation we used with the REST API.

#### DogNotFoundException.java
```java
public class DogNotFoundException extends RuntimeException implements GraphQLError {
    private Map<String, Object> extensions = new HashMap<>();

    public DogNotFoundException(String message, Long invalidDogId) {
        super(message);
        extensions.put("InvalidDogId", invalidDogId);
    }

    @Override
    public List<SourceLocation> getLocations() {
        return null;
    }

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getExtensions() {
        return extensions;
    }

    @Override
    public ErrorType getErrorType() {
        return ErrorType.DataFetchingException;
    }
}
```

__GraphQLError__ : provides a field called extensions. this allows you to pass additional data to the error object that is sent back to the client. so when the message goes back to the client, it will have a generic error message that's defined "Dog Not Found".

## 13. Case Study: Testing

어플리케이션을 실행시켜 톰캣에 띄우고 Postman 을 사용해서 테스트를 해 본다.

Postman 상에서 localhost:8080/graphql 으로 post 요청을 보내면 되는데, Headers 에 Key로 'Content-Type' 을, Value로 'application/json' 을 준다.

그 다음 Body에 raw format 으로 

```
{
	"query":"{findAllDogs {id name breed origin} }"
}
```

이렇게 적어준 뒤 요청을 보내면 로컬 H2 database 에 저장된 내용이 모두 출력되게 된다.

---

## 14. Case Study: GraphiQL

GraphiQL is a simple web app that is able to communicate with any GraphQL server, and you are able to execute queries and mutations against it. 

localhost:8080/graphiql 로 접속하여 원하는 query 와 mutation 을 실행시키고 그 자리에서 확인할 수 있다.

```
{
  findAllDogs {
    id name breed origin
  }
  
  findDogById(id:2) {
    name
  }
  
}
```

이런식으로 쿼리를 보낼 수 있음.
