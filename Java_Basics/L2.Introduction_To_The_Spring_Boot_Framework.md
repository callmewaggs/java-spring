Microservice : a software development technique that allow you to take larger application and decompose or break into smaller cases. So it's easy to manage.

## 2.Microservice And MVC framework

### Microservice

To sum up, microservice is the most popular architectures in today’s world. And almost all major companies are replacing their Monolith architectures with microservice architectures.

### MVC Framework

__MVC stands for Model-View-Controller__, which is an architectural pattern that separates an application into __three main logical components: the model, the view and the controller__. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development frameworks to create scalable and extensible projects.

__Model__ : data related logic. Model can be represented as data being transferred between the View and the Controller or other logic related data.

__Controller__ : Controller components usually handles most of the works which act as our interface between model and view to __process business logic.__ 어떤 처리에 대한 요청이 오면 Model component 를 사용하여 데이터를 가공하여 View 에게 넘겨 렌더링 할 수 있도록 한다.

__View__ : handle UI logic of application. 강력한 자바스크립트 라이브러리의 등장으로 많은 개발자들이 백앤드에서 프론트앤드로 넘어가고 있음.

## 3.Spring Boot Introduction

The Spring Boot framework is probably the most used framework for java-based microservices. Spring Boot is a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone and production-grade spring application. Developers can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup. In a way, Spring Boot really helps you to speed up your application development without many required configuration you need for spring. 

### Spring Boot advantage
 * simplifies your Spring dependencies, no more version collisions.
 * can be run straight from a command line without an application container.
 * build more with less code - no need for XML, not even web.xml, auto-configuration.
 * useful tools for running in production, database initialization, environment specific config files, collecting metrics.

### Spring Boot(Icing) vs Spring(Cake)
 * Configure
 * Xml
 * Controlling
 * Use

Spring framework uses less libraries and memories, which makes it simpler and faster compared to other frameworks. Threrefore, Spring framework is a light-weight solution compared to others. And Spring Boot is built on top of Spring.

### Spring Boot Project Structure

The entry point for Spring boot application is a class file named Application. __@SpringBootApplication__ is a convenience annotation that add all of the following.

 * __@Configuration__ tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.

 * __@EnableAutoConfiguration__ tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.

 * Normally you would add __@EnableWebMvc__ for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.

 * __@ComponentScan__ tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package, allowing it to find the controllers.

The main() method uses Spring Boot’s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application. Did you notice that there wasn’t a single line of XML? No web.xml file either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you didn’t have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

You would notice a file under resources folder called __application.properties__ , which is a file used to change application environment. You can also use command line or YAML to change the properties configuration to run the application.

If you open the pom file, you will see two dependencies have already been added. We will use lots of this file later. Luckily, with IntelliJ, when we add a dependency in our java class, it will automatically be added in this file.
