## 2.Microservice And MVC framework

### Microservice

To sum up, microservice is the most popular architectures in today’s world. And almost all major companies are replacing their Monolith architectures with microservice architectures.

### MVC Framework

__MVC stands for Model-View-Controller__, which is an architectural pattern that separates an application into __three main logical components: the model, the view and the controller__. Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application. MVC is one of the most frequently used industry-standard web development frameworks to create scalable and extensible projects. 


<img width="349" alt="mvc" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35681772/63665753-ba73fa80-c807-11e9-8f25-41c9d877c1e5.png">

__Model__ : data related logic. Model can be represented as data being transferred between the View and the Controller or other logic related data.

__Controller__ : Controller components usually handles most of the works which act as our interface between model and view to __process business logic.__ 어떤 처리에 대한 요청이 오면 Model component 를 사용하여 데이터를 가공하여 View 에게 넘겨 렌더링 할 수 있도록 한다.

__View__ : handle UI logic of application. 강력한 자바스크립트 라이브러리의 등장으로 많은 개발자들이 백앤드에서 프론트앤드로 넘어가고 있음.

## 3.Spring Boot Introduction

The Spring Boot framework is probably the most used framework for java-based microservices. Spring Boot is a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone and production-grade spring application. Developers can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup. In a way, Spring Boot really helps you to speed up your application development without many required configuration you need for spring. 

### Spring Boot advantage
 * simplifies your Spring dependencies, no more version collisions.
 * can be run straight from a command line without an application container.
 * build more with less code - no need for XML, not even web.xml, auto-configuration.
 * useful tools for running in production, database initialization, environment specific config files, collecting metrics.

### Spring Boot(Icing) vs Spring(Cake)
 * Configure
 * Xml
 * Controlling
 * Use

Spring framework uses less libraries and memories, which makes it simpler and faster compared to other frameworks. Threrefore, Spring framework is a light-weight solution compared to others. And Spring Boot is built on top of Spring.

### Spring Boot Project Structure

The entry point for Spring boot application is a class file named Application. __@SpringBootApplication__ is a convenience annotation that add all of the following.

 * __@Configuration__ tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.

 * __@EnableAutoConfiguration__ tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings.

 * Normally you would add __@EnableWebMvc__ for a Spring MVC app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. This flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.

 * __@ComponentScan__ tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the hello package, allowing it to find the controllers.

The main() method uses Spring Boot’s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application. Did you notice that there wasn’t a single line of XML? No web.xml file either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you didn’t have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

You would notice a file under resources folder called __application.properties__ , which is a file used to change application environment. You can also use command line or YAML to change the properties configuration to run the application.

If you open the pom file, you will see two dependencies have already been added. We will use lots of this file later. Luckily, with IntelliJ, when we add a dependency in our java class, it will automatically be added in this file.

## 4.Spring Boot MVC Development 

 * Controller
 * RestController
 * Servlet, Filter and Listener


### Controller

#### HelloController.class
```java
@Controller
public class HelloController {
   private Map<String, Object> result = new HashMap<>();

   @RequestMapping("/hello")
   @ResponseBody
   public Map<String, Object> hello() {
       result.put("name", "Stephen");
       result.put("city", "San Jose");
       return result;
   }
}
```

### Resources:

__JSON__ : https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp

---

### RestController

__@RestController is a specialized version of controller, which includes @Controller and @ResponseBody.__ 

Steps:

1. Replace the @Controller with @RestController.

2. Remove @ResponseBody annotation.

#### Common http request methods
 * PUT
 * GET
 * POST
 * DELETE
 * PATCH

---

### Servlet, Filter and Listener : used by java backend server to receive requests, manipulate them and respond with responses.

### Servlet

Servlet is a technology/API/class that is used to __create handle requests in web applications.__ Reside in server side, __Spring Boot uses Servlet to receive requests from client side.__ There are two ways in Spring Boot to use Servlet Api:

1. Use @ServletComponentScan annotation.
2. Use @Bean annotation.

#### HelloServlet.class
```java
@WebServlet(name = "helloServlet", urlPatterns = "/helloServlet")
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    @Override
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) throws ServletException, IOException {
        System.out.println("Running Hello Servlet doGet method");
    }
}
```

Add the @ServletComponentScan under @SpringBootApplication in your Application.

The @ServletComponentScan is making SpringBoot scan for @WebServlet annotation and it’s only performed when using an embedded web server such as Spring Boot.


### Resources:

__ServletComponentScan__ :  https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/web/servlet/ServletComponentScan.html

---

### Filter

Filter is a component that is used to preprocessing and postprocessing requests. It can be used to validate, encrypt/decrypt, log requests. For instance, it can filter out request if it contains some invalid content, or ignore requests that do not contain required request parameter.

```java
@WebFilter(filterName = "helloFilter", urlPatterns = "/helloServlet")
public class HelloFilter implements Filter {
    @Override
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {

    }

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest servletRequest, ServletResponse servletResponse, FilterChain filterChain) throws IOException, ServletException {
        System.out.println("Executing doFilter method");
        filterChain.doFilter(servletRequest, servletResponse);
        System.out.println("Done executing doFilter method");
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() {

    }
}
```

Results like : 
1. Executing doFilter method
2. Running Hello Servlet doGet method
3. Done executing doFilter method

---

### Listener for Servlet - instructions

Servlet Listener is used for listening to events in a web container, such as when you create a session or create a attribute in a session. 


#### HelloListener.class
```java
@WebListener
public class HelloListener implements ServletContextListener {
    @Override
    public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent sce) {
        System.out.println("Servlet Context Initialized");
    }

    @Override
    public void contextDestroyed(ServletContextEvent sce) {
        System.out.println("Servlet Context Destroyed");
    }
}
```

Results like : 
1. When you start the application : "Servlet Context Initialized"
2. When you kill the application : "Servlet Context Destroyed"

---

### Servlet with Bean - instructions
Let’s create servlet with bean. Bean is a very important concept in Spring. There are many definitions about what’s Bean. To make it short, __Bean is an object that is used by Spring IoC container.__

### Resources:

Bean: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/spring_boot/spring_boot_beans_and_dependency_injection.htm

Spring IoC: https://howtodoinjava.com/spring-core/different-spring-ioc-containers/

1. Remove @ServletComponentScan annotation in Application class.
2. Add the following method to Application class

#### Application.class
```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class SpringBootHelloworldApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootHelloworldApplication.class, args);
    }

    // Register Servlet
    @Bean
    public ServletRegistrationBean getServletRegistrationBean() {
        ServletRegistrationBean servletBean = new ServletRegistrationBean(new HelloServlet());
        servletBean.addUrlMappings("/helloServlet");
        return servletBean;
    }

    // Register Filter
    @Bean
    public FilterRegistrationBean getFilterRegistrationBean() {
        FilterRegistrationBean filterBean = new FilterRegistrationBean(new HelloFilter());
        filterBean.addUrlPatterns("/helloServlet");
        return filterBean;
    }

    // Register Listener
    @Bean
    public ServletListenerRegistrationBean<HelloListener> getServletListenerRegistrationBean() {
        ServletListenerRegistrationBean listenerBean = new ServletListenerRegistrationBean(new HelloListener());
        return listenerBean;
    }
}

```

---

### Bean


Bean : an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container.

IoC : a process in which an object defines its dependencies without creating them.

### Resources:

https://www.baeldung.com/spring-bean.

<br>

 * If a web application has Servlet, Listener and Filter classes. Listener will be instantiated first by the server.

 * FilterChain is used by the filters to get the next component invoked.

 * ServletRequest can not be used by the listeners and servlets of an application for sharing information b/w them.

---

### Use Static resources

You may have noticed if you start your application and goto localhost:8080 direct, you will get an ugly error message. Let’s fix that by understanding how the static resource works in spring boot.

Let’s create an image folder under static folder. And copy any image you have on your computer to it. I am using a book logo.

Let’s create a html page with the following content.

#### resources > static > index.html
```html
...
<body>
<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<img src="images/Full_Moon_Service.jpeg" alt="Moon" />
</body>
...
```

---

### Spring Boot application for file upload - instructions

### resources > static > index.html
```html
<h3>File Upload</h3>
<form action="upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
   Select file: <input type="file" name="attach"/><br />
   <input type="submit" value="Upload">
</form>
```

### UploadController.class 
```java
@RestController
public class UploadController {
    Map<String, Object> result = new HashMap<>();
    /// Receive message
    @RequestMapping("/uploadFile")
    public Map<String, Object> upload(@RequestParam("attach")MultipartFile file) throws IOException {
        // File info
        System.out.println("File name = "  + file.getOriginalFilename());
        System.out.println("File type = " + file.getContentType());

        // Save to disk
        // file path example 1) Windows c:/, 3) Mac ~/Documents/

        /*
        new File( multipart.getOriginalFilename()) this will create file in server location
        where sometime you will face write permission issues for the user,
        its not always possible to give write permission to every user who perform action.
        System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir") will create temp directory where your file will be created properly.
        This way you are creating temp folder, where file gets created , later on you can delete file or temp folder.
        */
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir"));
        File convFile = new File(System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir")+"/"+file.getOriginalFilename());
        file.transferTo(convFile);
        // String filePath = "~/Documents/";
        //file.transferTo(new File(filePath + file.getOriginalFilename()));
        result.put("Success", true);
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Spring Boot File Upload

In case you have having issue with uploading big files. You can update the application.properties with the following statement

```
spring.http.multipart.maxFileSize=XXXMB
```

In case you want to try multiple files, you can update the configuration to
```
spring.http.multipart.maxRequestSize=XXXMB
```
