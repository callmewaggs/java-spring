# L3.Spring_Boot_Template_Engine

## What is Template Engine

Template Engine combines data model with source template to produce result documents. The result document can be any file type.

 * Data model : any various of data (can be database, xml, spreadsheet, etc.)
 * Source template : any file types (can be html, xml, etc.)
 * Template engine : connect to data model and processing code in source template.
 * Result document : result of the partial or entire document.

Template Engine connect data and template as input. and output of template engine is result document.

## Three major template engine
 * Freemarker
 * JSP
 * Thymeleaf

### Freemarker Introduction
FreeMarker is a Java based template engine package from Apache.

FreeMarker work as a sequential text processor which is a different approach compared to Thymeleaf. But again, FreeMarker is a new project, and I see the potential in it. In this lesson, we are going to briefly show how to use FreeMarker in SpringBoot. If you are interested in FreeMarker, please feel free to check it out at its website: https://freemarker.apache.org/.


### Resources:

Few things you might noticed during the development. We are using @Controller this time rather than @RestController. To clarify, __@RestController is used to tell that the response sent from your controller should be sent to the browser__, usually an object mapped to json. It is the same as adding @ResponseBody.

We are adding the view in template rather than static folder.

## Spring Boot Template Engine - Thymeleaf

### Thymeleaf
 * Parses XHTML/HTML pages
 * An in-memory template engine
 * Relies mostly on attributes instead of tags

### UserController.class
```java
@Controller
public class UserController {
    
    @RequestMapping("demo")
    public String demo(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "hello Thymeleaf");
        return "demo";
    }
}
```

### resources > templates > demo.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" xmlns:th="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Thymeleaf Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
    <span th:text="${message}"></span>
</body>
</html>
```

One thing you need to add to your html header is ```xmlns:th="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"```, which tells the html I am using thymeleaf engine.
