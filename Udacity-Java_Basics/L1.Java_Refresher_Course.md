## 3.Java Basic Apis - String

Java math, date, string and character are really basic yet useful java APIs.

### Resources:

__Math__: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html
 * Need to import java.lang
 * 모든 Math 메서드들은 static 이기 때문에 생성자가 따로 필요 없음.
 * Common methods : ceil, floor, rint, round, abs, max, min, pow, sqrt, random
   * rint(double a) : Returns the double value that is closest in value to the argument and is equal to a mathematical integer.
   * random() : Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.

__Date__: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html

## 4.Java Basic APIs - StringBuilder, StringBuffer, Regex

The StringBuilder and StringBuffer class creates a mutable sequence of characters. Different than String, StringBuilder and StringBuffer are mutable. Both classes create a mutable sequence of characters. And they are very much similar to each other.

However the StringBuilder provides no guarantee of synchronization whereas the StringBuffer class does. And Regex, aka, regular expression, is used to match or filter out Strings. 

### Resources:

__StringBuilder__: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuilder.html

__StringBuffer__: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/StringBuffer.html

__Regex__: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html

## 5.Java Basic APIs - Binary Search, Recursion, Big-O Notation

### Binary Search

### Recursion
 * Pros of using recursion
   * Reduces length of program.
   * Very flexible in data structure like stacks, queues, linked list.
   * Big and complex iterative solutions are easy and simple using recursion.
   * Algorithms can be defined recursively making it much easier to visualize and prove.
 * Cons of using recursion
   * Slow.
   * Logical but difficult to trace and debug.
   * Requires extra storage space. For every recursive calls separate memory is allocated for the variables.
   * Recursive functions often throw a Stack Overflow Exception when processing or operations are too large.


### Big-O Notation
 * O : Order of the function
 * N : number of the element

## 6.Collections


## 7.Collections - List

 * List 는 인터페이스. ArrayList 와 LinkedList 가 주로 쓰이는 구현체다.

### Resources:

 * ArrayList: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html
    * Use dynamic array to store element.

 * LinkedList: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html
    * Use doubly-linked list to store element.

---

## 8.Collections - Stack and Queue

### Resources:
 * Stack: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html
   * First in Last Out
 * Queue: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Queue.html
   * First in First Out

---

## 9.Collections - Map and Set

### Resources:
 * __Map__: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html
   * Map stores an element in key and element fashion, that is, when you store an element, you will give it a key for Map to retrieve and manipulate it easily.
   * Two common Map implementations are HashMap(no order) and TreeMap(ordered map).
   * map 에서 이미 존재하는 key 에 대한 value 를 추가하는 경우 update 된다(old value to new value).

 * __Set__: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Set.html
   * Set stores elements by using hashing.
   * Two common Set implementations are HashSet(no order) and TreeSet(ordered set).
   * set 에서 이미 존재하는 key 에 대한 value 를 추가하는 경우 무시된다(ignored).

### 개발 환경

## 11.Exception and File IO

### Exception

Exception is a problem that arises during run-time.

If there is no exception handling mechanism, when exception happens, the system basically crash. Therefore, we need to find a way to properly handle our exceptions, so we can find out the problem while keeping our application running.

### File IO

Java IO is an API that comes with Java to read and write data. Most of the applications today support IO, for instance, ask user to upload a data feed, ask user to upload a photo, generate a PDF after user complete the form, grade students’ online exam and send the report as email.

IO Stream is like an endless flow of data. You can either read from a stream or write to a stream. A stream is connected to a data source or a data destination. Streams in Java IO can be either byte (reading and writing bytes) based or character based (reading and writing characters).

The File class in the Java IO API gives you access to the underlying file system. Using the File class you can:

 * Check if a file or directory exists.
 * Create a directory if it does not exist.
 * Read the length of a file.
 * Rename or move a file.
 * Delete a file.
 * Check if path is file or directory.
 * Read list of files in a directory.

### Stream

Stream is like an endless flow of data. You can either read from a stream or write to a stream. A stream is connected to a data source or a data destination. Streams in Java IO can be either byte (reading and writing bytes) based or character based (reading and writing characters).

A program that needs to read data from some source needs an InputStream or a Reader. A program that need to write data to some destination needs an OutputStream or a Writer. Can show a graph like

 * [source] -> [input stream/reader] -> [program]

 * [program] -> [output stream/writer] -> [destination]

FileInputStream and FileOutputStream are common input and output stream classes. FileReader and FileWriter are common reader and writer classes. 

 * Input Stream : FileInputStream
 * Output Stream : FileOutputStream
 * Reader : FileReader
 * Writer : FileWriter


#### FileInputStream

FileInputStream obtains input bytes from a file. It’s used for reading byte-oriented data such as image data, audio, videos. You can also read character-stream data. But, it’s recommended to use FileReader class to read character stream data.

Java FileOutputStream is an output stream used for writing data to a file. If you have to write primitive values into a file, use FileOutputStream class. You can write byte-oriented as well as character-oriented data through FileOutputStream class. But, for character-oriented data, it is preferred to use FileWriter than FileOutputStream.

FileReader is used to read character-oriented data from a file and FileWriter class is used to write character-oriented data to a file.

#### Resources:

FileInputStream: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/FileInputStream.html

FileOutputStream: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/?java/io/FileOutputStream.html

FileReader: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/?java/io/FileReader.html

FileWriter: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/?java/io/FileWriter.html

### Buffer, BufferedReader

__Buffer is a region of a physical memory storage used to temporarily store data__ while it’s being moved from one place to another. The physical memory storage would be RAM in most case. For file IO, buffer is a storage stores part of the streamed data and feeds this to output.

When we use a buffer what happens is that each character is stored in the buffer first one by one in consecutive memory locations thus converting the stream of data into a single solid value.

Java __BufferedReader__ class is used to read the text from a character-based input stream. It can be used to read data line by line by __readLine()__ method, it can also be used to read data character by character by __read()__ method. By sure to __close bufferreader__ as well if you finish use it.

## 12. Programming Exercise

Complete the “find top k larger number” in an unsorted integer array.

Given an unsorted integer array, return the top k larger number in a sorted list. The k is always less than array size. Make sure the time complexity is less than O(nlogn).

Example 1: [-1, 15, 59, 22, 6, 42, 45, 0], k=4, return {22, 42, 45, 59}

Example 2: [5, 10, 22, 100, 8], k=2, return {22, 100}

```java
public static List<Integer> topKLarget(int[] arr, int k) {
  TreeSet<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
  for (int num : arr) {
    treeSet.add(num);
    if(treeSet.size() > k) {
      treeSet.pollFirst();
    }
  }
  return treeSet.stream().collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

물론 TreeSet을 사용하지 않고 sort 를 사용하여 결과를 낼 수도 있겠지만, 그렇게 했을때의 시간복잡도보다 add 와 동시에 order 를 유지하는 TreeSet 을 사용하는 편이 시간복잡도를 줄일 수 있다.
